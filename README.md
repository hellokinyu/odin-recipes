In this project, I aim to become more familiar with

1. The workflow of using Git and GitHub. When to commit, writing proper commit messages, using the terminal line to use Git.
2. Making HTML boilerplates from scratch.
3. Working with HTML to create a basic webpage.

I hope to gain an understanding of how everything works together, and establish a deeper appreciation for Git and its system.
